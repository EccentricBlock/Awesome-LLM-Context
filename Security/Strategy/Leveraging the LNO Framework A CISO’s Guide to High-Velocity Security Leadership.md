# Leveraging the LNO Framework: A CISO’s Guide to High-Velocity Security Leadership

## What is the LNO Framework?

The **LNO Framework** is a task prioritisation method that classifies your activities into three categories: **Leverage**, **Neutral**, or **Overhead**. Unlike basic to-do lists that treat all tasks equally, LNO forces you to ask: *“How impactful will the result of this task be for the business?”*. This framework doesn’t just consider *when* to do something (like the Eisenhower urgent/important matrix does) – it also considers *how well* to do it. In other words, it guides how much effort and quality to invest in different tasks for maximum overall impact.

> **“You can increase your impact on the organization (and reduce the tremendous stress that often accompanies the job) by avoiding the trap of doing a great job on all tasks. Seek leverage – actively try to do a bad job for certain tasks.”** – Shreyas Doshi ([LNO (Leverage, Neutral, Overhead) Framework for Product Managers](https://www.aakashg.com/lno-framework-for-product-managers/#:~:text=On%20Feb%201%2C%202020%2C%20the,%E2%80%9D)) (productivity expert, on the importance of prioritising effort)

In simple terms, not all tasks are created equal, so you shouldn’t treat them equally. Some things you should strive to **ace**; others you should do **adequately** and move on; and some you should do **minimally** (or eliminate entirely). Let’s define each L, N, and O category in plain language:

### Leverage (L) Tasks – *“Do these exceptionally well.”*

**Leverage tasks are your **high-impact, high-return work**.** These are the activities that create outsized benefits for the organisation – often *10x or 100x returns* on the effort invested. If you execute an L task brilliantly, it significantly multiplies your team’s output or your security posture. These tasks typically have **long-term, scalable benefits** beyond their immediate output. They often: 

- **Drive strategic objectives or foundational improvements** (e.g. designing a company-wide security architecture or developing a security strategy that aligns with business growth).
- **Produce lasting solutions** rather than one-off fixes (e.g. building an automated incident response system that will save future time).
- **Influence many people or future decisions** (e.g. establishing a security training programme that elevates security awareness across the whole company).

Because of their high impact, leverage tasks **deserve your best effort and focus**. You should aim for excellence here – it’s worth the time. *“Give these tasks your best effort. Perfectionism is welcome here.”* as one LNO guide explains. Doing an L task “good enough” versus “great” can mean the difference between a moderate outcome and a transformative one.

**Examples of Leverage tasks for a CISO:** Developing a multi-year security roadmap, mentoring and training your engineering team on secure coding (multiplying security knowledge), implementing a critical risk mitigation that prevents major breaches, or rolling out an innovative security feature that becomes a market differentiator. These are tasks where extra hours yield exponential returns in reduced future incidents, higher trust, or enabling the business to move faster **with security built-in**.

### Neutral (N) Tasks – *“Do these well enough to meet requirements.”*

**Neutral tasks are the **routine, keep-things-running work** that yields proportional results to effort.** Put in X amount of work, you get roughly X amount of benefit (or only slightly more). Doing an N task perfectly doesn’t significantly improve outcomes beyond doing it well – but doing it poorly **has a downside**. In other words, N tasks don’t offer big upside for going above-and-beyond, but they *do* carry risk if neglected. These tasks are often necessary for operations and have a **baseline standard** you must meet for things to run smoothly.

Characteristics of Neutral tasks:
- They **maintain the status quo or support ongoing functions** (e.g. routine risk assessments or regular compliance checklists that keep you in line with regulations).
- **Exceeding the baseline** (gold-plating the task) typically has diminishing returns. Once it’s “good enough,” extra polish doesn’t translate to significantly more security or value.
- However, **failing to do them properly can cause problems**. For example, if you shortcut a neutral task like updating a firewall rule correctly, it could lead to a minor incident. So they need to be done with care, but not with perfectionism.

The mindset for N tasks is **efficient execution**: do a solid job, but **don’t sink extra time** that could be better spent on L tasks. As Shreyas puts it, *“Do these tasks with usual efficiency, so you have more time for Leverage.”*. Meet the requirements, then move on.

**Examples of Neutral tasks for a CISO:** Conducting a routine vendor security review, preparing a standard quarterly security report for the board, managing an incident response (contain and remediate) to restore normal operations, updating an existing policy to align with a new regulation, or performing a scheduled access rights audit. In each case, there’s a clear need to do it reasonably well (to avoid security gaps or stakeholder unhappiness), but investing triple the time won’t necessarily yield triple the benefit. Once the vendor is vetted or the incident is resolved and lessons captured, the mission is accomplished – *extra rounds of analysis or beautifying the report likely won’t dramatically improve security outcomes*.

### Overhead (O) Tasks – *“Do these minimally – or eliminate them.”*

**Overhead tasks are the busy-work, low-return activities that *have to be done* but do not directly improve future output.** These tasks often feel like pure **bureaucracy or admin**. They might be necessary for compliance or politeness, and sometimes they benefit others, but they provide negligible value to your core security objectives *relative to the time spent*. In fact, many overhead tasks are prime candidates for **delegation, automation, or even outright skipping** if possible.

Key signs of Overhead tasks:
- **Little to no upside even if done perfectly.** If you poured extra effort into an O task, you wouldn’t get much more credit or value out of it. For instance, meticulously formatting an internal expense spreadsheet or obsessively proofreading minutes of a meeting – it won’t make your company safer, it’ll just be a slightly prettier output.
- **“Good enough” is truly good enough.** These tasks usually just need to reach an acceptable threshold (or simply be completed). Doing them *quick and dirty* is usually fine – **done is better than perfect** here. Your natural CISO perfectionism should be dialed *way* down.
- They often feel like **compliance tick-boxes or redundant process steps**. Perhaps they exist due to company bureaucracy or temporary lack of better systems. Think of tasks that make you mutter, “Why do I even have to do this…?”

For overhead tasks, the recommended approach is to **spend the minimal possible time and mental energy**. One product manager quipped that you should *“actively try to do a bad job”* on O tasks – not because you want failure, but because even your “bad job” will usually be perfectly serviceable and you’ll have saved precious time ([the-lno-framework-sorting-your-work-by-impact (1).md](file://file-1EnSZHuzPApFLM55JBD8Y7#:~:text=better%20than%20they%20do)). The ultimate goal is to **reduce or eliminate overhead tasks** through clever workarounds or by empowering others. In an ideal world, you eventually architect these tasks out of your own workload entirely (more on that later).

**Examples of Overhead tasks for a CISO:** Filling out lengthy security questionnaires that a sales team requests *after* you’ve already provided the info elsewhere, formatting slides or documents to a specific template purely for form’s sake, logging hours or updating internal tracking systems that nobody important really reads, attending recurring meetings that aren’t relevant but you’re invited as a formality, or responding to endless email threads where your input isn’t critical. For instance, updating the same data in three different tools because various stakeholders insist on their report format – that’s overhead. Another example: if you must provide a weekly status report and you find yourself spending two hours perfecting wording and alignment, you’re likely dealing with overhead (the value of the report was probably in the first 15 minutes of content; the rest was cosmetic). **The key is to recognise these time sinks and not over-invest in them.**

## Why Focus on Leverage? – The Startup CISO’s Lens

In a high-velocity startup, time and resources are incredibly scarce. Every hour you spend on one thing is an hour not spent on something else – this is the **opportunity cost**. Adopting a **leverage-focused mindset** is critical in such an environment because it ensures your limited time produces the greatest possible benefit for your organisation. Here’s why the leverage lens is so powerful for a startup CISO:

- **You are a Force Multiplier.** As an executive and security leader, your primary job is not to firewall *every single server yourself*; it’s to enable *the whole organisation* to be secure. Andy Grove (former Intel CEO) defined a manager’s output as *“the output of their organisation plus the output of neighbouring organisations under their influence.”* In other words, your impact comes from **multiplying others’ performance**. High-leverage activities allow you to influence many others’ work or future work. For example, spending time to train developers in secure design now might prevent dozens of vulnerabilities (work you *won’t* have to do later). That’s far more valuable than personally configuring one application firewall (which affects only one system). Great leaders identify high-leverage actions and **give those appropriate time and attention**.

- **Startups have to **move fast without breaking things (too much)**.** You can’t afford to be the department of “No” or a bottleneck. By focusing on leverage tasks, you invest in security initiatives that *scale* – that allow the company to grow safely at speed. For instance, establishing an automated DevSecOps pipeline or a self-service security portal for engineers is a high upfront effort (L task) that later saves you from manually reviewing every code change (reducing tons of future N/O work). In contrast, if you get bogged down reviewing every minor access request (O task) or polishing an exhaustive policy document for weeks (likely N task), you may miss the chance to implement strategic controls that would have a much bigger effect on risk reduction.

- **Too much Neutral/Overhead work leads to burnout and “firefighter mode.”** In a startup, new issues pop up daily – a new customer questionnaire, a minor incident, a request from finance for input, etc. It’s easy to drown in reactive Neutral tasks and bureaucratic Overhead. If you treat *everything* as important and urgent, you’ll end up extinguishing small fires all day and never building fireproof walls for the future. The LNO mindset reminds you that **not all tasks are equal** in value. By intentionally doing *just* an adequate job on lower-value tasks (and saying “no” or deferring when appropriate), you reclaim time for proactive, strategic efforts. This shift can dramatically reduce stress. Shreyas Doshi noted that when he stopped trying to do a great job on every little thing and instead concentrated on leverage, his feeling of overwhelm dropped and his impact soared.

- **Leverage secures the *future*, not just the present.** A strong leverage focus aligns with being **proactive vs. reactive**. Many security incidents are urgent (and you must react), but if all you do is react, you’ll just keep fighting yesterday’s battles. High-leverage security tasks (like threat modelling a new product early or instituting an incident post-mortem process that drives systemic fixes) might not scream for attention today, but they prevent disasters *tomorrow*. In a startup aiming to scale 10x, those forward-looking improvements pay off hugely. It’s the difference between patching one vulnerability versus establishing a robust patch management program – the latter yields ongoing resilience.

- **Demonstrating leverage to stakeholders builds trust.** Startup executives and boards want to see that security enables the business. When you prioritise leverage tasks, you can more clearly articulate how security initiatives add value. For example, delivering a streamlined compliance automation (L task) that cuts audit prep time by 50% is a big win you can brag about. It shows you’re not just handling security for today but also creating efficiency and supporting growth. This “business alignment” is crucial for a CISO to be seen as a strategic partner rather than a cost centre. It’s much harder to demonstrate value if all your time is sunk into necessary-but-uninspiring neutral tasks (like endless risk assessments or paperwork); those are expected baseline, not game-changers.

In summary, a leverage mindset in a startup means **being deliberate about where you invest your energy**. Aim to spend the majority of your time on what truly moves the needle for security and the business. By doing so, you amplify your impact and avoid the trap of **“we’re incredibly busy, but not making real progress.”** As one prioritisation formula puts it: *focus on tasks that maximise (Value Created – Time Cost) / Time Taken*. In a startup, that often means **creative shortcuts on the low-value stuff, and bold investment in the high-value stuff**.

## How to Classify Tasks: A Practical L/N/O Rubric

It’s not always immediately obvious which bucket a given task falls into. As a CISO, many of your duties might *feel* important. To help distinguish Leverage vs Neutral vs Overhead in practice, use the following rubric. For any task on your plate, evaluate it against these criteria:

**1. Impact Magnitude:** *If done well, how much positive impact will this task have?*  
- **Leverage:** Yields **high impact** – e.g. significantly reduces risk, saves lots of future work, or enables major business initiatives. It’s aligned to top strategic goals or big risk reductions. *Example:* Implementing SSO across all apps (huge security and productivity win).  
- **Neutral:** Yields **moderate impact** – improves things incrementally or fulfills a known requirement. Important for stability but not groundbreaking. *Example:* Updating an HR policy to include a new data privacy clause (necessary compliance, but by itself won’t transform security posture).  
- **Overhead:** Yields **negligible direct impact** on core objectives – it might just satisfy bureaucracy or have value only on paper. *Example:* Manually re-entering vulnerability scan results from one system into another for reporting consistency. The security impact of this clerical work is essentially nil.

**2. Upside of Extra Effort:** *Does spending additional time/effort on this task significantly improve the outcome?*  
- **Leverage:** **Yes – huge upside.** The difference between an OK job and an excellent job is enormous in value. These tasks *reward* perfectionism. *Ask:* “If I put in double the effort, will the result be dramatically better for the company?” If yes, it’s likely leverage. For instance, thoroughly redesigning a weak network architecture vs. doing a quick patch: thorough redesign yields a far stronger security posture (worth the effort).  
- **Neutral:** **No big upside beyond “good enough.”** There’s a clear quality bar to hit, but after that, returns diminish. *Ask:* “If I do this 20% better than required, does anyone benefit meaningfully?” Usually no. Example: writing a incident report – it needs to be clear and accurate, but turning it into a 20-page masterpiece with literature review won’t materially help more than a concise 5-page report.  
- **Overhead:** **No upside at all for extra polish.** In fact, even doing it “half-heartedly” likely yields the same benefit as doing it perfectly. *Ask:* “Could I deliberately do this a bit sloppily and still have no one care or no harm done?” If yes, it’s overhead. Example: producing a weekly KPI report that only you and one other person glance at – if a graphic isn’t perfectly aligned, or if you write one sentence instead of three, it changes nothing of significance.

**3. Downside of Neglect or Poor Execution:** *What are the consequences if this task is done late, poorly, or not at all?*  
- **Leverage:** **Moderate downside**, but mainly you lose an opportunity. These tasks tend to be proactive, so if you drop them, you might not feel immediate pain – but you *do* miss out on a big potential gain or leave a latent risk unaddressed. For example, postponing a security architecture review (L task) might not cause a breach *today*, but you lose the chance to catch design flaws early (which could bite later).  
- **Neutral:** **Significant downside if ignored.** Neutral tasks often have an implied SLA or importance to operations. Not doing them properly can result in acute problems: compliance penalties, angry customers, security gaps. Using the earlier example: if you do a lousy job on the incident response process (neutral task) – say you fail to contain an incident or to communicate properly – the downside is big (damage spreads, trust erodes). Thus neutral tasks carry risk and must meet a certain standard.  
- **Overhead:** **Minimal downside beyond minor inconveniences.** Maybe someone will nag you if it’s not done, or you’ll create a bit of confusion, but no major harm. For overhead tasks, often the worst outcome is a *local* annoyance, not a strategic failure. For example, if you didn’t attend that optional meeting (and just read the minutes later), things would still be fine; or if your expense report had a typo, finance asks you to fix it – trivial impact.

**4. Frequency and Repeatability:** *Is this a one-off task or something recurring? Can it be automated or delegated?* (This helps identify overhead especially.)  
- **Leverage:** Often tasks that **create systems or capabilities** that handle future occurrences. They may be one-time heavy lifts that reduce effort on repeat tasks later. If it’s recurring, a leverage approach would be to automate it. *E.g.* If vulnerability triage is taking lots of time each month, turning it into a self-service tool or process this quarter is leverage.  
- **Neutral:** Usually **routine tasks that recur** (weekly, monthly, quarterly) or ad-hoc important requests. You can’t eliminate them entirely, but you might streamline them. If something recurs frequently and sucks time but is important, consider if any aspect can be templatized or handed off.  
- **Overhead:** Frequently **administrative or procedural repeat tasks** that could be done by someone with less context or by a script. If you find yourself doing a task frequently that doesn’t require your CISO expertise (like formatting a report, scheduling meetings, basic data entry), that’s a red flag of overhead. You should seek to delegate it to an assistant, team member, or script. Overhead can also be one-off trivial requests that add no value (like “Can you reorganise this spreadsheet columns for me because I prefer a different order?” – one-time but pure waste for you).

Use these criteria as a **mental checklist** for each item on your to-do list. A rigorous approach is to literally label each task “L”, “N”, or “O” once you’ve answered these questions. If a task scores high on impact and upside, it’s L. If its main attribute is “must do it right or bad things happen” but no extra credit for doing it superbly, it’s N. If it makes you think “ugh, this is just a chore” and there’s little benefit to doing it well, it’s O.

> **Pro tip:** *When in doubt, consider the **audience or beneficiary** of the task.* If the task’s primary beneficiary is the *business’s long-term success or many colleagues*, it leans toward Leverage. If the beneficiary is *keeping a particular stakeholder or process satisfied* (and they need it correct, but won’t give extra praise for above-and-beyond), it’s Neutral. If the only apparent beneficiary is *bureaucratic consistency* (no one would explicitly ask for more quality or detail), it’s likely Overhead.

Finally, remember that **context matters.** An activity could be Neutral in one context but Leverage in another. For example, a security **awareness training programme** might normally be considered a baseline necessity (N), but if crafted in an innovative way that truly changes employee behaviour and significantly reduces phishing incidents, it becomes a leverage activity for your org (massive long-term risk reduction!). Always evaluate tasks relative to your organisation’s goals and pain points.

## Mapping CISO Activities to L, N, O Categories

Let’s put theory into practice by classifying typical CISO responsibilities. Below is a mapping of common security tasks into Leverage, Neutral, or Overhead, with explanations. (Your context may vary, but these examples illustrate the thought process.)

| **CISO Activity**                   | **L/N/O**  | **Rationale** |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incident Response** (handling a security incident) | Neutral (with a Leverage twist) | **Neutral:** Managing an incident (detect, contain, remediate) is an urgent necessity – you must do it well enough to minimise damage. There’s not much *extra* upside to over-engineering the response beyond resolving it effectively. However, **leverage the aftermath**: conducting a blameless post-mortem and implementing systemic fixes can turn this into a leverage opportunity by preventing future incidents. In-the-moment = N (restore normal operations), Post-incident learning = L (improve for future). |
| **Policy Development** (writing or updating security policies) | Leverage | Crafting clear, relevant security policies is a foundational task that guides everyone’s behaviour. A well-designed policy (e.g. cloud usage policy) can influence hundreds of decisions across the company without your direct involvement – a classic high-leverage outcome. It sets security expectations and frameworks that **scale**. Doing this thoroughly and thoughtfully (vs. copy-pasting a generic template) yields outsized benefit in consistent compliance and risk reduction. |
| **Executive Reporting** (regular reports to C-suite/board on security) | Neutral (sometimes Overhead) | **Neutral:** Reporting to executives is important for transparency and support; you need to present accurate info and some insight. But spending triple the time to make the report flashy or perfect has limited added value – the execs mainly need the key points. As long as it’s clear and factual (baseline met), extra polish is usually unnoticed. It can veer into **Overhead** if it becomes a ritual of form over substance (e.g. endlessly tweaking slide formats or data that executives don’t act on). Aim to satisfy the core questions (“Are we secure? What’s our risk? What do you need?”) and resist the urge to overdo cosmetics. |
| **Risk Assessments** (evaluating security risks for systems/projects) | Neutral (could be Leverage if actioned) | **Neutral:** Performing risk assessments is a necessary practice to understand and communicate threats. You should do them diligently (missed risks can bite later – high downside if done poorly), but an assessment itself usually doesn’t reduce risk; it informs decisions. Thus it’s typically proportional output: a thorough assessment gives a good view of risk (required), but making it *extraordinarily* detailed yields little extra benefit if the main risks have been identified. However, if you **use** a risk assessment to drive a major risk reduction initiative (e.g. discover a critical gap and then fix it), that subsequent project is leverage. The assessment is the means to an end (N leading to an L task). |
| **Vendor Security Reviews** (assessing third-party suppliers) | Neutral | **Neutral:** Vendor reviews are often mandatory (especially for compliance or procurement). A baseline review (checking their security certifications, scanning for known issues) protects you from obvious supplier risks – necessary due diligence. Doing it well avoids a downside (breach via a vendor), but going *above* the baseline (e.g. performing an in-person audit for a low-risk vendor) might not be justified. Once you’ve deemed a vendor “reasonably safe” or required them to fix things, extra depth has diminishing returns. This task can become **Overhead** if you over-repeat it or if the process is overly manual; consider templates or have an analyst handle the heavy lifting where possible. |
| **Compliance Initiatives** (e.g. achieving certifications, meeting regulatory requirements) | Neutral (potentially Leverage in business context) | **Neutral:** Meeting compliance obligations (GDPR, ISO 27001, SOC 2, etc.) often falls on the CISO. These tasks ensure you meet a baseline standard – essential (downside of non-compliance is fines or lost business), but doing more than required doesn’t necessarily make the company safer. Treat compliance work as neutral: satisfy the requirements efficiently. That said, in a **business sense**, a compliance project can be leverage **if** achieving it opens up significant new revenue (e.g. getting a security certification earlier than competitors could win big customers). As a security task alone, it’s baseline; as a strategic business enabler, it edges toward leverage. Balance the two by not over-engineering controls beyond what auditors expect, but also leveraging the effort by marketing your compliance to customers. |
| **Threat Intelligence Analysis** (tracking external threats, intel feeds) | Neutral (sometimes Overhead) | **Neutral:** Staying informed on threat intel can help you preempt risks (valuable), but it can also be a time sink if not focused. Consuming intel has a roughly proportional benefit – read 5 reports, you gain some insight; read 50, you might gain slightly more but at high time cost. If you identify a relevant threat and act on it (patch systems, alert teams), it pays off (that action is leverage – preventing an incident). However, passively reading intel without action can slip into **Overhead** (interesting but not applied). To keep this neutral-or-better, align intel monitoring with your top risks and have a plan for what kinds of intel trigger action. Otherwise, limit time spent doom-scrolling security news. |
| **Security Awareness Training Programme** (educating employees) | Leverage (if done right; Neutral if minimal) | **Leverage:** A well-run security awareness programme can significantly elevate your organisation’s human firewall. If employees learn to detect phishing, use strong passwords, report incidents early, etc., you reduce the likelihood of breaches caused by human error – a *multiplying effect* across the company. Designing engaging training tailored to your company (and reinforcing it regularly) is a high-leverage initiative: it changes culture and behaviour in ways that make everyone a partner in security. *However*, a perfunctory annual slideshow just to tick a box would be mere **Neutral/Overhead** (meeting a compliance requirement with no real behaviour change). The key is **quality and relevance** – putting effort here yields exponential benefit in risk reduction, so it’s worth treating as a leverage task. |

*Table: Categorising common CISO tasks as Leverage (L), Neutral (N), or Overhead (O). Note how some tasks can shift category based on approach.* 

As you map your own duties, remember it’s not black-and-white. Context and execution matter. The goal isn’t to label tasks *just for labeling’s sake*, but to decide **where to spend your energy.** If something is Neutral, you plan to do it to a sufficient standard and *then stop*. If it’s Overhead, minimize or delegate it aggressively. If it’s Leverage, block quality time for it and knock it out of the park.

## Integrating Other Prioritisation Frameworks

The LNO framework plays nicely with other classic prioritisation and productivity tools. By combining these approaches, you get a well-rounded system to decide *what* to do, *when* to do it, and *how much effort* to give it. Here’s how to apply a few popular models alongside LNO:

### **1. The Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent–Important Quadrants)**

Dwight Eisenhower’s matrix helps you sort tasks by **urgency** and **importance**, traditionally into four quadrants: 
- **Urgent & Important (Do first)**, 
- **Important but Not Urgent (Schedule time)**, 
- **Urgent but Not Important (Delegate or quick action)**, 
- **Neither (Eliminate or postpone)**.

**How it complements LNO:** 
- **Focus on *Important* = Aligns with Leverage/Neutral.** Generally, tasks that are truly important (contribute to your goals) will be either Leverage or Neutral. Leverage tasks are often in the **“Important but not Urgent”** quadrant – for example, developing a security strategy is vital but can usually be scheduled with deliberation, since no one is screaming for it today. The risk is these get postponed indefinitely because urgent issues suck up your time. *Use the Eisenhower approach to deliberately schedule L tasks* into your week as high priority, even if they’re not on fire. Treat that strategy workshop or automation project with the same calendar respect as an urgent meeting.
- **Urgent & Important tasks** (Eisenhower Q1) often correlate to **Neutral tasks** in LNO. For instance, an active security incident is urgent and important – you must respond now (Eisenhower says “Do it now”). In LNO terms you handle it as a Neutral task: effectively and efficiently, but you probably can’t turn it into a perfectionist project in the moment (nor should you delay it). The key is to *resolve it* (Q1: do it), then afterwards consider any leverage follow-ups once urgency is past.
- **Urgent but Not Important tasks** (Eisenhower Q3) are prime candidates for **Overhead**. These are tasks that demand attention now but don’t actually matter much in the big picture – e.g. a last-minute request for metrics that aren’t critical or an invite to a meeting about office seating plans. Eisenhower would say *delegate or decline* these. LNO agrees: these are overhead if they’re not contributing to your security mission, so do them only if you must, as minimally as possible or push them to someone else. Don’t let Q3 tasks consume prime hours.
- **Not Urgent & Not Important (Eisenhower Q4)** is basically *pure waste* – often these tasks drop off the list entirely. If you identify something in this quadrant, it’s likely an O task you can eliminate. For example, if you’ve been routinely compiling a report that no one reads (not important) and there’s no deadline pushing it (not urgent), it might be time to stop doing it at all. Free up that time for L tasks.

**Using Eisenhower + LNO:** At the start of each week, you might plot your tasks on an Eisenhower matrix to clarify scheduling: ensure urgent items are planned or delegated, and critically, block time for the important-but-not-urgent tasks (many of which will be your Leverage projects). This prevents the *tyranny of the urgent* from crowding out your long-term security improvements. Conversely, use LNO to decide how much effort to allocate: for each quadrant, apply the appropriate L/N/O mindset (e.g. Q1 tasks: do them well but quickly = likely Neutral; Q2 tasks: make time and do with high quality = often Leverage; Q3: delegate or minimal effort = Overhead; Q4: cut = Overhead elimination).

### **2. Andy Grove’s Managerial Leverage Lens (High Output Management)**

Andy Grove introduced the concept of **managerial leverage** – some activities have a greater effect on your team’s output than others. As a CISO, you are a manager and leader, so this lens is highly relevant. 

**Key idea:** *The output of a manager = the output of their team + the output of others they influence.* Therefore, tasks that **increase your team’s output or capabilities are high-leverage by nature** ([High Output Management](https://matthewkudija.com/reading-notes/2021-04-11-High-Output-Management.html#:~:text=,a%20long%20period%20of%20time)). This includes actions like coaching your team, setting up good processes, clarifying strategy, and making effective decisions.

**How to apply it:** When identifying **Leverage (L) tasks**, ask: “Does this task **multiply the output** of my security team or other teams?” If yes, it’s likely a top candidate for leverage. Examples:
- **Training & mentoring staff** – If you help one of your security engineers get 10% more efficient or an developer learn secure coding, that improvement echoes in all their future work (classic high leverage).
- **Improving a process** – Time spent now to streamline incident triage or automate a control yields ongoing time savings for the whole team (leveraging every future incident response).
- **Making a strategic decision or aligning with executives** – A clear decision on security priorities can focus the efforts of many people. An hour spent with the CTO to agree on “we will implement MFA on the product this quarter” could guide hundreds of hours of engineering work in the right direction.
- **Recruiting or delegating** – Hiring a competent security analyst to take over routine monitoring (even though hiring itself is time-consuming) is high-leverage because it *massively extends your capacity*. Similarly, effectively delegating a task to a team member can multiply results; you free yourself for other work and they grow.

Essentially, the managerial leverage perspective helps you justify investing in tasks that *enable others*, even if those tasks don’t produce a direct technical artifact. Sometimes security leaders feel guilty spending time on “soft” tasks like one-on-ones, training, or cross-team meetings – but those are often your highest leverage opportunities as a leader. In contrast, if you find yourself doing something an individual contributor could do, and it doesn’t require your level of authority or expertise, that’s low leverage and probably Neutral or Overhead for you – consider delegating it.

**High Output Management also urges:** *“Choose to perform tasks that possess high leverage”*. Use this as a guiding mantra when faced with a packed task list: which of these tasks will **create the most output per unit time**? Those are your L’s to prioritise. And if a task has low leverage (affects little and affects only the moment), try not to let it dominate your day.

### **3. Other Tools and Principles**

- **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule):** This classic rule states that ~80% of effects come from 20% of causes. In your context, it means likely a handful of activities (the 20%) drive the majority of your security outcomes. Perhaps 20% of identified risks account for 80% of your exposure, or 20% of your projects bring 80% of the value. Use this as a compass: identify those critical few tasks or risk areas that contribute disproportionately to security and make sure those are your Leverage focus. For instance, if you realize that “secure configuration management” and “employee phishing training” would mitigate a large chunk of your issues, double down on those (make them L tasks), and consider trimming effort on more niche issues that aren’t as impactful.
- **OKRs and Strategic Alignment:** Align tasks to your **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** or strategic goals. If you have a company OKR to, say, launch in a new market that requires specific compliance, tasks enabling that have higher leverage (they’re directly tied to a key objective) compared to tasks that are tangential. Regularly mapping your to-do list against strategic goals can reveal which tasks are truly driving outcomes (likely L or important N) and which are “noise” (likely O). If a task doesn’t clearly support any objective or mitigate a top risk, question why you’re doing it at all.
- **The “Three Ds” – Delete, Delegate, Defer:** This is a quick tactic for incoming tasks (often tied to inbox or request management). When something new comes in, immediately decide: **Delete** (not do at all, if it’s not worthwhile – fits O tasks), **Delegate** (if someone else can handle it 80% as well in less time – good for O or some N tasks), or **Defer** (schedule it for later if it’s important but not urgent – often L tasks go here so you protect time to do them properly, or N tasks go into planned slots). This prevents you from automatically accepting every task as your own responsibility to do perfectly. It’s a mini implementation of LNO: deleting = eliminating overhead, delegating = offloading overhead or neutral to others, deferring = making space for leverage at the right time.
- **Time Boxing and Pomodoro Technique:** While not a prioritisation framework per se, these productivity techniques support LNO by controlling how long you spend on tasks. For Overhead tasks, **time-boxing** is your friend: e.g., “I will spend *no more than 30 minutes* ordering and cleaning up these logs for compliance, then I’m sending it as-is.” This ensures overhead tasks don’t balloon. For Neutral tasks, you might use a Pomodoro (25-minute focused sprint) to knock them out efficiently, then move on. For Leverage tasks, you might allocate larger blocks (an hour or two of deep work) to really dive in without interruption. The key is being conscious: set a timer or block for O and N tasks to limit them, and *guard longer blocks for L tasks* so you can achieve flow state on those high-value projects.

By weaving these tools together, you create a robust system: **LNO gives the qualitative focus (impact/effort), Eisenhower helps schedule by urgency, and leverage thinking ensures you’re amplifying your team, not just yourself.** Meanwhile, Pareto/OKR alignment keeps you tied to big-picture outcomes, and time-boxing keeps you efficient. 

## Implementing LNO: An Operational Playbook

Understanding the framework is one thing – living it day-to-day is another. In this section, we’ll outline a concrete playbook to bake LNO prioritisation into your routine as a security leader. Think of this as a personal operating procedure to ensure you consistently apply the leverage lens and keep your work aligned with what matters most.

### **Step 1: Capture and Categorise Your Tasks**

Begin by getting **visibility** into everything on your plate. Use whatever tool suits you (task app, spreadsheet, notebook) to list all your current responsibilities, projects, and incoming to-dos. Once you have the list, **label each with L, N, or O**. Be brutally honest about the true impact of each task. If helpful, write a one-line justification for the category (this forces clarity). For example:

```
[L] Develop incident response automation playbook – will save hours in future incidents.
[N] Complete customer security questionnaire – needed for sale, but just meets their checklist.
[O] Update org chart in security wiki – low value, anyone could do this or it can wait.
```

*(The above is an example snippet of how you might annotate your to-do list. Notice the L/N/O tags and brief reasoning.)*

If you have a huge number of tasks, you can also categorize in batches: identify a handful of obvious Leverage tasks first (usually the ones tied to strategic initiatives or pressing risks), then mark obvious Overhead (things you wish you could drop), and the rest are likely Neutral. **This exercise brings immediate clarity** – many overwhelmed CISOs find that out of a flood of duties, only a few truly move the needle. Those are where you want to spend most of your time.

**Tip:** Color-code or group tasks by category. For instance, you might highlight L tasks in **green**, N in **yellow**, O in **red** on your task tracker. This visual cue helps when scanning your list or calendar – you instantly see “how much green vs red” is present.

### **Step 2: Ruthlessly Eliminate or Delegate Overhead**

Now, tackle the **Overhead (O)** items on your list. For each O task, ask:
- *Can I **stop doing** this outright with minimal consequences?* Often overhead tasks persist out of habit or because no one challenged them. If nobody important would miss it, consider dropping it. Example: do you really need to attend that weekly ops meeting that no longer addresses security topics? If not, gracefully bow out.
- *If it must be done, can it be **delegated**?* Perhaps a junior team member, an IT support person, or an administrative assistant could handle it with a bit of guidance. Delegation has the added bonus of giving others growth opportunities or freeing you for higher-order work. Example: assign the task of updating the asset inventory spreadsheet to your security analyst, or ask an IT intern to first-draft the policy formatting.
- *Can it be **automated or streamlined**?* This is where a CISO’s ingenuity comes in. If you find yourself doing an overhead task repeatedly, spend a leverage hour to find a tool or script to do it. Even writing a simple script to pull that weekly report data automatically, or creating an email template for common responses, can convert recurring overhead into a non-issue. 

For any overhead tasks that remain (some paperwork and admin might unavoidably stick with you), **time-box them**. Allocate a small window in your schedule for these necessary evils and stick to it. For example, **block Friday 4–5 PM as “admin cleanup.”** During that time, crank through expense approvals, time sheets, minor updates – and then **shut it down**. Don’t let these tasks sprawl beyond their allotted corral. Remember, **“Done is better than perfect”** for O tasks, so resist any perfectionist urges here.

By trimming overhead, you immediately free up capacity. It’s not glamorous work, but it’s like decluttering your desk – once done, you can focus much better on what matters.

### **Step 3: Optimise and Time-Bound Neutral Tasks**

Next, look at your **Neutral (N)** tasks. These are important to execute, but you want to do them in the most **efficient, controlled manner** possible, so they don’t eat up time needed for leverage work. Strategies for N tasks:

- **Schedule them strategically.** Since N tasks often have deadlines or regular cadence (reports, meetings, maintenance routines), put them on your calendar in a sensible way. For instance, cluster routine meetings back-to-back on two afternoons per week. This leaves other days or mornings free for deep work. If you have a weekly risk review and a weekly IT sync, maybe schedule them both on Wednesday, allowing you larger uninterrupted blocks on other days.
- **Set quality thresholds – then stop.** Define what “good enough” looks like for each Neutral task before you start. Example: *“This policy update needs to cover the new cloud usage guidelines and be reviewed by legal. Once those changes are made and checked, I will consider it done.”* Avoid scope creep or gold-plating. It’s easy to get sucked into, say, polishing wording or adding extra analysis – but if it meets its requirements, close it and move on to the next priority. Remind yourself that any extra time spent is likely low ROI.
- **Use templates and checklists.** Neutral tasks often repeat, so having standard operating procedures can save time. Keep a library of templates: an incident report template, a risk assessment checklist, a board report slide deck outline, etc. This way, each time the task comes up, you’re not starting from scratch or reinventing the wheel. It also reduces errors (helping ensure you meet that baseline each time without overthinking it).
- **Where possible, combine Neutral tasks with Leverage outcomes.** This is a bit of an advanced tactic: see if a necessary neutral task can feed into something higher-impact. For instance, if you conduct a quarterly risk assessment (N task), use its findings to update your security roadmap (L task) – don’t just file the assessment away. Or if you’re writing an executive report (N), use part of it to also advocate for a new project you consider leverage. This way, the time spent on the neutral task also pushes forward a leverage agenda.

Also, be mindful of **meeting sprawl**, a common Neutral trap. As a CISO, you’ll get many meeting invites. Not all deserve equal attention. For each meeting, ensure there’s a purpose for your presence. If it’s informational and not critical, maybe ask for notes afterwards instead (saving you an hour). If it’s a recurring meeting that’s lost relevance, propose scaling back frequency. Guard your time; meetings can stealthily convert your week of potential L work into a string of N obligations. Keep them in check by consolidating and culling where appropriate.

### **Step 4: Prioritise and Protect Leverage Tasks**

Now for the fun part – your **Leverage (L)** tasks, the high-impact projects that will truly elevate your security program. For these, do the opposite of what we did for overhead: **allocate prime time, and strive for excellence.** Here’s how:

- **Identify your peak productivity periods** and **block them for L tasks**. Whether you’re a morning person or a night owl, reserve those golden hours for deep, focused work on things like strategy development, architecture design, or important analyses. Treat these blocks as non-negotiable appointments with yourself. If your calendar is visible to others, mark them as busy (you can label it as “Project Work” or similar). This way, people are less likely to double-book you. As Andy Grove noted, **the most important resource you control is your time** – so consciously invest it where it yields the highest return.
- **Break big leverage projects into milestones**. Large initiatives (e.g. “Implement company-wide zero trust model”) can be daunting and easy to postpone without interim targets. Break them into smaller L tasks (e.g. “This week: draft network segmentation plan” as one step). This creates momentum and gives you a sense of progress, which is motivating. It also allows you to sprinkle some leverage work even in busy weeks – maybe you can’t finish the whole project, but you can achieve a chunk.
- **Apply creativity and quality focus.** Leverage tasks are where you want to *over-deliver*. Use creative thinking: how can this solution be not just good, but truly elegant or far-reaching? Since you’ve freed time from O and contained your N tasks, you can afford to invest extra energy here. For example, if you’re designing an employee security training, think of novel ways to engage people (interactive drills, maybe a fun internal phishing contest with prizes) rather than just the basic slideshow. These extra touches can make the difference between a forgettable program and a culture-changing one. It’s in L tasks that your **A-player output** will shine and be remembered.
- **Solicit feedback and iterate** (if time permits). Because these tasks have long-term payoff, it’s worth getting them right. For instance, when developing a security policy or a new process, involve a few stakeholders early, get input, and refine. This ensures the final output is robust and broadly effective. In contrast, you wouldn’t bother with extensive feedback cycles for an overhead task. For L tasks, that extra refinement can multiply adoption or success (e.g. engineers actually follow a process they helped shape).
- **Keep a scoreboard of completed L tasks.** It’s motivating to see the tangible outcomes of your leverage efforts. You might maintain a simple log: each week or month, note what major L outputs you achieved (e.g. “Deployed automated container security scanner – 10x improvement in coverage”). This not only feels rewarding, it also equips you with talking points to demonstrate your team’s value to others. It reinforces why focusing on leverage is worth it.

Most importantly, **defend those leverage time blocks**. There will be weeks when an emergency or deadline forces you to push aside some planned work – that’s life in a startup. But make that the exception, not the norm. If you consistently sacrifice strategic work for firefighting, wave a red flag to yourself: it might be a sign you need to delegate more or that something is wrong systemically. It may even be worth discussing with the CEO or management team – startups can fall into the trap of valuing only the immediate. Part of your role is to educate them that *proactive security work prevents bigger fires.* In short, treat your L tasks as *first-class citizens* on your schedule, not the “when I get time” items.

### **Step 5: Use Tools to Track and Reinforce LNO**

To make LNO a sustained habit, it helps to build a feedback loop. Here are some operational tools and practices to consider:

- **Weekly LNO Review:** At the end of the week (or start of the next), take 15 minutes to review how your time aligned to L, N, O. Did you spend roughly the proportions you intended? (For instance, maybe you aimed for 60% on L, 30% on N, 10% on O.) If you find, say, O creeped up to 30%, identify why – perhaps a one-off administrative fire drill happened. How will you avoid that next time? This reflection ensures you continuously correct course. It can be as simple as scribbling in a notebook: *“Last week: 2 big L tasks done, but too many minor requests took time. Next week: push more of those to IT support.”*
- **Task Management Systems:** Use a Kanban board or task app with L/N/O tags. For example, in Trello or Jira you might have a label or swimlane for L, N, O. As tasks come in, label them. When planning your day or week, pick mostly from the L lane first. Some CISOs even maintain three separate lists. This visual separation helps you consciously choose a balance. It also feels good to move a card from “Doing” to “Done” especially in the L column!
- **Calendar Color-Coding:** Extend your earlier color-coding to your calendar events. If possible, color your events by category (many calendar tools let you assign colors or use separate calendars you overlay). For instance, mark strategy sessions or project work blocks in green (L), routine meetings in yellow (N), and admin in red (O). At a glance, you’ll see if your week ahead looks too red/yellow heavy. Aim to adjust it before the week begins – maybe by cancelling a non-essential meeting or delegating a check-in – and adding more green blocks. Over time, you want a “greener” calendar.
- **Team Involvement:** If you have a security team, consider introducing them to LNO concepts as well. Not only does this lighten your load (they can take some N or O tasks), it also empowers them to prioritise and pushes leverage thinking throughout the team. For example, your security engineer might realise an internal script they write (L for them) could save everyone time, versus manually doing a task each week (N for them). You can even make it fun: during team meetings, everyone can share one leverage thing they did that week. It reinforces a culture of working smarter, not just harder.
- **Accountability Partner or Coach:** Adhering to a new way of working can be hard, so find a way to hold yourself accountable. Maybe it’s a fellow exec at the startup (the CTO or COO) who also is trying to prioritise better – you could do a quick chat each Friday: “What was your big leverage win? What overhead did you cut?” If that’s not available, even journaling or telling your CEO your plan can create a sense of commitment. Since you’re in a high-level role, you might even invest in a leadership coach who can periodically check in on how you’re focusing your efforts. They can remind you to keep leverage front-of-mind when urgent chaos threatens to distract you.

### **Step 6: Adjust and Evolve**

Finally, treat this as an **iterative process**. Startups evolve rapidly – new priorities, new threats, new business directions. Revisit your L/N/O categorisation whenever things significantly change. That compliance project you labelled N might turn into an L if suddenly landing a huge customer depends on it. Or a task that was L last quarter (perhaps setting up basic cloud security controls) might now be done and off your list, with new leverage tasks (like enabling a secure data analytics pipeline) taking its place.

Every few months, or at least bi-annually, do a higher-level retrospective: Are your leverage activities truly delivering the expected impact? Is there any area you’re neglecting? Also check if you inadvertently let some overhead creep back in (it has a way of doing that!). Continuous improvement applies here as it does in security; refine your personal prioritisation system with lessons learned.

Also, celebrate the results. If you successfully freed 20% of your time from grunt work and used it to implement a key security feature or avoid a crisis, that’s a win for you and the company. Recognise these victories – it will motivate you to stick with the methodology and it will demonstrate to others the value of working smart. You might find colleagues start asking *“How do you manage so much?”* – and you can share a bit of your secret sauce.

## Conclusion

Stepping into a CISO role at a high-growth startup is both exhilarating and overwhelming. The demands will only increase as the company scales. By adopting the LNO Framework and a leverage-oriented mindset, you can **turn frantic activity into focused productivity**. You’ll ensure that the hours you invest translate into meaningful improvements in security and business enablement, rather than just keeping the wheels turning.

Remember:
- **Leverage tasks are your high-value bets** – nurture them, knock them out of the park, and they will pay back tenfold.
- **Neutral tasks are your steady maintenance** – do them well, but efficiently. No more, no less.
- **Overhead tasks are the clutter** – clear them out, delegate, or contain them so they don’t clutter your schedule.

Use the tools at your disposal – prioritisation matrices, time management techniques, delegation, automation – to reinforce these principles. Over time, you’ll instinctively start seeing the “leverage angle” in new requests or problems, and you’ll become adept at triaging what really deserves your attention.

Finally, embrace a coaching mindset with yourself (and your team). Be patient but firm in making these changes to how you work. Old habits of trying to do everything die hard. There may be weeks you slip up and spread yourself too thin. That’s okay – learn from it and course-correct. The fact that you are intentionally prioritising puts you miles ahead in the game of startup leadership.

In a fast-paced environment, focusing on leverage is like steering with a compass rather than just rowing harder. It ensures that all your effort propels you in the right direction. With this guide, you have a compass and a map. Now go forth and lead your startup’s security to new heights, with less stress and more impact.
